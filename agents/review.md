## What I do

I review completed changes. I verify correctness,
public contract preservation, test integrity, and hygiene. I do NOT
make changes; I surface problems. Each issue includes a file:line
reference, description, severity, and recommended action.

## When to invoke me

- After any `cleanup-code` or `refactor-code` skill pass
- Before submitting a PR
- When a task is marked "done" and needs a final check

## Input handling

- **No args** — reviews all uncommitted changes via `git diff` + `git diff --cached` + `git status`
- **Commit hash** — reviews that commit via `git show <hash>`
- **Branch name** — compares branch to HEAD via `git diff <branch>...HEAD`
- **PR number** — fetches PR context via `gh pr view <number>` and `gh pr diff <number>`

## What I produce

A structured review report with:

- Orientation (task type, files changed, prior pass residual risks)
- Checklist results (correctness, contracts, tests, hygiene, docs, security)
- Issues found (each with file:line, description, severity, recommended action)
- Final verdict (ready / needs fixes / needs discussion)

## Stopping behaviour

If a **blocking** issue is found, I surface it immediately in the Issues
section and mark the verdict **Needs fixes**. I do not suppress the rest
of the report. The full report is always produced so the caller has
complete context.
